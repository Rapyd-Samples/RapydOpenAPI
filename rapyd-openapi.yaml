        The response provides a unique beneficiary ID, which you can use in place of the Beneficiary object for Create Payout.
        This method triggers the Beneficiary Created webhook. This webhook contains the same information as the response.
        Note: In addition to the required fields documented below, you must include all other beneficiary fields listed in the response to Get Payout Required Fields, and you must conform to the regex provided.
        To create a beneficiary that you can use with multiple payout methods, include all fields that are required by each payout method.
        The client is responsible for including all required fields.
